                Working with Zillan is like a breath of fresh air. JD and Paul
                really went above and beyond to fully educate me on the process,
                and they handled everything from A--Z when it came time to
                close. I was initially intimidated by the deal because of all
                the paperwork and details. The guys took the time to make sure I
                was informed on my decision. To be honest, I’m not sure I’ll
                ever do business with anyone else. I’m so confident in these
                individuals that I fully recommend them to my friends and
                family.

                Thank you for all your help with the sale of my home. With my
                situation as a single mom of two young children and having to
                relocate back home to Connecticut, I needed to sell my home and
                sell it fast! The transaction went very quickly, easily, and it
                was a pleasure working with you two gentlemen. If I have any
                future real estate transactions I will give Zillan a call and
                will also recommend you to my friends.

                It was very nice working with you on the purchase of 21st. As a
                seller’sagent, you were extremely professional and helpful. If I
                can ever be of assistance to you, your buyers, or any Realtor
                you may work with, I’dcertainly appreciate the referral. My

                time, if not early. Again, thank you.
